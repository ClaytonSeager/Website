                    <dd>
                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet
                        off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden
                        floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                        quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience
                        also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
                        running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located
                        in the lodge.

                        Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most
                        guests also pack comfortable walking shows and plan to
                        dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.
